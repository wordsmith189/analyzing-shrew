```{r setup}
if (!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")
library(pacman)
p_load(rio, tidyverse, tidytext, flextable,
       kableExtra, textreadr, janitor, knitr)

               cache = F)
```

## The data: gold-standard preparation

We have pre-cleaned the data and hand-coded it for genre. That is the gold standard. In addition, speech prefixes were retained and systematically set to all-caps. Stage directions were removed. Below is a screenshot of the current version.

```{r, echo=F, fig.cap="Current version of the text: pre-cleaned and hand-tagged for genre."}
knitr::include_graphics("shrew_markup.png", dpi=190)
```

### Loading the file into R

Reading in the file, the head looks as below.

```{r}
text <- read_docx("shrew_markup.docx") %>% 
  enframe("linenumber", "text")

text  %>% 
  slice(65:75) %>% 
  kbl(caption="The text as initial R object.") %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

### Current size

The text has been read line-by-line. The current length is `r nrow(text) %>% format(big.mark=" ")` lines. As we process it, we'll find out the number of words.

## Further processing

The following things need to happen before any analysis.

1. We'll want to convert the text to one-word-per-row format. This step typically (a) removes all punctuation and (b) changes upper-case to lower-case letters. We **don't really want either** of these, but getting rid of punctution is darn useful. So we will want punctuation removed, but we need to do something to retain the valuable genre-tagging. To address a), then, I'll change our XML format tags (e.g. `<prose>...</prose>`) to lexical tags, i.e. made-up words I can be sure Shakespeare didn't use in the play: `prosestart ... proseend`, `versestart ... verseend`. This will allow me to still remove any punctuation while retaining the genre tagging. 

<aside>Why not? Because are relying on capitalization to identify speech prefixes, and on punctuation to identify genre tagging.</aside>

2. Edit those speech prefixes that, like the huntsmen, consist of more than one token.
3. Mark each line for current act.
4. At this point, "tokenize", i.e. change format to one-word-per-row.
5. Identify all words in all-caps spelling -- we know these are the speech prefixes. Use them to mark each row for the current speaker.
6. Identify all genre tags. Use them to mark each row for `prose` or `verse` as genre.

I'll now work down this list and show the state of the text after each conversion.

#### Change genre tags to lexical tags

```{r}
text <- 
  text %>% 
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, 
                                "<prose>", " prosestart "),
         text = str_replace_all(text, 
                                "</prose>", " proseend "),
         text = str_replace_all(text, 
                                "<verse>", " versestart "),
         text = str_replace_all(text, 
                                "</verse>", " verseend "),
         )
text %>% 
  slice(65:75) %>% 
  kbl(caption = "Data after genre tags have been changed from XML format to lexical forms.") %>% 
  kable_styling()
```


#### Edit speech prefixes

I went back to the DOCX file to be able to read better, and tried to find any character name that consisted of more than one token. Here are the ones I came up with. 

<aside>Do let me know if I overlooked any. Additions can be easily made.</aside>

- <1. HUNTSMAN>: change to HUNTSMAN1
- <2. HUNTSMAN>:  change to HUNTSMAN2
- <3. SERVANT>:  change to SERVANT3
- <2. SERVANT>:  change to SERVANT2
- <1. SERVANT>:  change to SERVANT1

```{r}
text <- 
  text %>% 
  mutate(text = str_replace_all(text, 
                                "<1. HUNTSMAN>", " HUNTSMAN1 "),
         text = str_replace_all(text, 
                                "<2. HUNTSMAN>", " HUNTSMAN2 "),
         text = str_replace_all(text, 
                                "<3. SERVANT>", " SERVANT3 "),
         text = str_replace_all(text, 
                                "<2. SERVANT>", " SERVANT2 "),
         text = str_replace_all(text, 
                                "<1. SERVANT>", " SERVANT1 ")
         )
```

No need to display the result here.

#### Mark acts

Based on the tagging of the current text, we will recognize act beginnings by the sequence `|A` at the beginning of a line.

```{r}
text <- 
  text %>% 
  mutate(
  act =  cumsum(str_detect(text,
                             regex("^Actus", 
                                   ignore_case = T)
                           )
                ),
  act = act + 1
  )

text %>% 
  slice(65:75) %>% 
  kbl(caption = "Data after act has been assigned.") %>% 
  kable_styling()
```


#### Tokenize

We have covered our bases now and can use the default setting of the `unnest_tokens()` function with regard to removal of punctuation, but not with regard to lower-casing across the board.

```{r}
text <- 
  text %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text, to_lower = FALSE)

text %>% 
  slice(65:75) %>% 
  kbl(caption = "Data after tokenization, with option `to_lower = FALSE`.") %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

We can now determine that the play has `r nrow(text) %>% format(big.mark=" ")` words, as that is the number of rows in the text object after tokenization.

#### Mark each row for current speaker

We're adding a new column and marking for each word who the speaker is.

```{r detect speaker, message=F, warning=F, eval=F}
text <- text %>% mutate(speaker = NA)
speaking <- NA
for (i in (1:nrow(text))) {
  currentword <- text %>% slice(i) %>% pull(word)
  if (currentword == toupper(currentword) & 
      nchar(currentword) > 1) {
    speaking = currentword
  }
  text$speaker[i] <- speaking
  if (i %% 500 == 0) {
    cat(i, "\n")
  }
}
text %>% export("text_speakers.RDS")
```

```{r}
text <- import("text_speakers.RDS")

text %>% 
  slice(65:85) %>% 
  kbl(caption = "Data after speaker has been assigned.") %>% 
  kable_styling()
```
Now that the speaker tagging in a dedicated column is in place, we will also remove those rows that contain only a speech prefix. 

```{r}
text <- 
  text %>% 
  filter(word != toupper(word))
```

#### Mark each row for current genre

```{r detect genre, message=F, warning=F, eval=F}
text <- text %>% mutate(genre = NA)
currentgenre <- NA
tagwords <- c("prosestart", "versestart")
for (i in (1:nrow(text))) {
  currentword <- text %>% slice(i) %>% pull(word)
  if (currentword %in% tagwords) {
    currentgenre = currentword
  }
  if (currentgenre == "prosestart") {
    text$genre[i] <- "prose"
  } else {
    text$genre[i] <- "verse"
  }
  if (i %% 500 == 0) {
    cat(i, "\n")
  }
}
text %>% export("text_genre.RDS")
```

```{r}
text <- import("text_genre.RDS")

text %>% 
  slice(65:85) %>% 
  kbl(caption = "Data after genre has been assigned.") %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

Now that genres are tagged as well, we will also remove those rows that contain only a (lexical) genre tag. 

```{r}
text <- 
  text %>% 
  filter(! word %in% c("prosestart", "versestart", "proseend", "verseend"))
```

## The final file

Here is a last view of the data, this time a bit longer.

```{r}
text %>% 
  slice(65:125) %>% 
  kbl(caption = "Data after processing.") %>% 
  kable_styling()
```
