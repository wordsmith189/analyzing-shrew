## The data: gold-standard preparation

We have pre-cleaned the data and hand-coded it for genre. That is the gold standard. In addition, speech prefixes were retained and systematically set to all-caps. Stage directions were removed. Below is a screenshot of the current version. 

```{r, echo=F, fig.cap="Current version of the text: pre-cleaned and hand-tagged for genre."}
knitr::include_graphics("shrew_markup.png", dpi=150)
