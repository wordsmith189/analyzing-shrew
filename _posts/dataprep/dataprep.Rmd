```{r setup}
if (!require(pacman)) install.packages("pacman")
library(pacman)
p_load(rio, tidyverse, tidytext, knitr, flextable,
       kableExtra,
       textreadr, janitor)
opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE,
               cache = TRUE)
```

## The data: gold-standard preparation

We have pre-cleaned the data and hand-coded it for genre. That is the gold standard. In addition, speech prefixes were retained and systematically set to all-caps. Stage directions were removed. Below is a screenshot of the current version. 

```{r, echo=F, fig.cap="Current version of the text: pre-cleaned and hand-tagged for genre."}
knitr::include_graphics("shrew_markup.png", dpi=190)
```

Reading in the file, the head looks as below.

```{r}
text <- read_docx("shrew_markup.docx") %>% 
  enframe("linenumber", "text")
text  %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  kbl(caption = "The text as initial R object.") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F, 
                position = "left") 
```
