By conducting some counts and visualizations here of the distributions in our variables of interest, we are moving into what data scientists call descriptive statistics. (And the next level of statistical complexity would be called predictive statistics, or modeling, or machine learning, or AI.)\n\nOur “variables of interest” are, for now: genre, speaker, and act.\nMany digital text analysis projects are best served by careful descriptive statistics, and this is one of them.\n\n\n\nResearch questions\nReceived from Doug Bruster via email.\nHow many words of verse in this play?\nHow many words of prose?\nHow many of each does each character speak?\nWhat is the overall sentiment of the verse speeches?\nWhat is the overall sentiment of the prose speeches?\nIs there a discrepancy in the sentiment of the verse a certain character speaks as opposed to the sentiment of the prose he or she speaks (that is, a wider or narrower gap than the average difference of the two media)?\nAre verse and prose made up of different kinds of words (for example, are the words in one medium longer in terms of character count than the other)?\nAre the lexicons of verse and prose ordered differently? (That is, do the most frequent words differ from one to the other?)\nText volume by genre, character, act\n\n\n\nCharacter\nFirst, let’s see which character has how many words.\n\n\n\n(#fig:n words char)Number of words per character.\n\n\n\nGenre\n\n\n\n(#fig:words gnr)Number of words per character.\n\n\n\nGenre and Character\n\n\n\n(#fig:char by genre)Number of words per character and genre.

That is the gold standard. In addition, speech prefixes were retained and systematically set to all-caps. Stage directions were removed. Below is a screenshot of the current version.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Current version of the text: pre-cleaned and hand-tagged for genre.\n\n\n\nLoading the file into R\nReading in the file, the head looks as below.\n\n\nTable 1: The text as initial R object.\n\n\nlinenumber\n\n\ntext\n\n\n65\n\n\nAnd when he says he is, say that he dreams,\n\n\n66\n\n\nFor he is nothing but a mighty lord.\n\n\n67\n\n\nThis do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;\n\n\n68\n\n\nIt will be pastime passing excellent,\n\n\n69\n\n\nIf it be husbanded with modesty. <\/verse>\n\n\n70\n\n\n<1.

The current length is 2 799 lines. As we process it, we’ll find out the number of words.\nFurther processing\nThe following things need to happen before any analysis.\nWe’ll want to convert the text to one-word-per-row format. This step typically (a) removes all punctuation and (b) changes upper-case to lower-case letters. We don’t really want either of these, but getting rid of punctution is darn useful. So we will want punctuation removed, but we need to do something to retain the valuable genre-tagging. To address a), then, I’ll change our XML format tags (e.g. <prose>...<\/prose>) to lexical tags, i.e. made-up words I can be sure Shakespeare didn’t use in the play: prosestart ... proseend, versestart ... verseend. This will allow me to still remove any punctuation while retaining the genre tagging.\n\nWhy not? Because are relying on capitalization to identify speech prefixes, and on punctuation to identify genre tagging.\nEdit those speech prefixes that, like the huntsmen, consist of more than one token.\nMark each line for current act.\nAt this point, “tokenize”, i.e. change format to one-word-per-row.\nIdentify all words in all-caps spelling – we know these are the speech prefixes. Use them to mark each row for the current speaker.\nIdentify all genre tags. Use them to mark each row for prose or verse as genre.\nI’ll now work down this list and show the state of the text after each conversion.\nChange genre tags to lexical tags\n\n\nTable 2: Data after genre tags have been changed from XML format to lexical forms.\n\n\nlinenumber\n\n\ntext\n\n\n65\n\n\nAnd when he says he is, say that he dreams,\n\n\n66\n\n\nFor he is nothing but a mighty lord.\n\n\n67\n\n\nThis do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;\n\n\n68\n\n\nIt will be pastime passing excellent,\n\n\n69\n\n\nIf it be husbanded with modesty. verseend\n\n\n70\n\n\n<1.

I interpret this to mean that there are characters that appear both in verse and in prose sections, and we want to know how the language associated with each character differs from verse to prose.\nIn the text samples I have, character speech is not marked. We might be better off if we pull Taming of the Shrew from www.gutenberg.org.\nLuckily there is an R module that interfaces with the Gutenberg archives. It is called gutenbergr. I will pull the whole text from there.\n\n\nshakespeare <- \n  gutenberg_works(author == \"Shakespeare, William\") \n\nshakespeare                    %>% \n  mutate(entry = row_number()) %>% \n  select(entry, title)  %>% \n  kbl() %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = \"striped\", \n                full_width = F, \n                position = \"left\") \n\nentry\n\n\ntitle\n\n\n1\n\n\nShakespeare’s Sonnets\n\n\n2\n\n\nVenus and Adonis\n\n\n3\n\n\nKing Henry VI, First Part\n\n\n4\n\n\nHistory of King Henry the Sixth, Second Part\n\n\n5\n\n\nThe History of King Henry the Sixth, Third Part\n\n\n6\n\n\nThe Tragedy of King Richard III\n\n\n7\n\n\nThe Comedy of Errors\n\n\n8\n\n\nThe Rape of Lucrece\n\n\n9\n\n\nThe Tragedy of Titus Andronicus\n\n\n10\n\n\nThe Taming of the Shrew\n\n\n11\n\n\nThe Two Gentlemen of Verona\n\n\n12\n\n\nLove’s Labour’s Lost\n\n\n13\n\n\nKing John\n\n\n14\n\n\nThe Tragedy of King Richard the Second\n\n\n15\n\n\nRomeo and Juliet\n\n\n16\n\n\nA Midsummer Night’s Dream\n\n\n17\n\n\nThe Merchant of Venice\n\n\n18\n\n\nKing Henry IV, the First Part\n\n\n19\n\n\nThe Merry Wives of Windsor\n\n\n20\n\n\nKing Henry IV, Second Part\n\n\n21\n\n\nMuch Ado about Nothing\n\n\n22\n\n\nThe Life of King Henry V\n\n\n23\n\n\nJulius Caesar\n\n\n24\n\n\nAs You Like It\n\n\n25\n\n\nHamlet, Prince of Denmark\n\n\n26\n\n\nThe Phoenix and the Turtle\n\n\n27\n\n\nTwelfth Night; Or, What You Will\n\n\n28\n\n\nThe History of Troilus and Cressida\n\n\n29\n\n\nAll’s Well That Ends Well\n\n\n30\n\n\nMeasure for Measure\n\n\n31\n\n\nOthello, the Moor of Venice\n\n\n32\n\n\nThe Tragedy of King Lear\n\n\n33\n\n\nMacbeth\n\n\n34\n\n\nAntony and Cleopatra\n\n\n35\n\n\nThe Tragedy of Coriolanus\n\n\n36\n\n\nThe Life of Timon of Athens\n\n\n37\n\n\nPericles, Prince of Tyre\n\n\n38\n\n\nCymbeline\n\n\n39\n\n\nThe Winter’s Tale\n\n\n40\n\n\nThe Tempest\n\n\n41\n\n\nThe Life of Henry the Eighth\n\n\n42\n\n\nA Lover’s Complaint\n\n\n43\n\n\nThe Passionate Pilgrim\n\n\n44\n\n\nTwelfth Night\n\n\n45\n\n\nRichard II\n\n\n46\n\n\nHenry IV, Part 1\n\n\n47\n\n\nHenry V\n\n\n48\n\n\nHenry VI, Part 1\n\n\n49\n\n\nHenry VI, Part 2\n\n\n50\n\n\nHenry VI, Part 3\n\n\n51\n\n\nRichard III\n\n\n52\n\n\nHenry VIII\n\n\n53\n\n\nCoriolanus\n\n\n54\n\n\nTitus Andronicus\n\n\n55\n\n\nTimon of Athens\n\n\n56\n\n\nHamlet\n\n\n57\n\n\nKing Lear\n\n\n58\n\n\nOthello\n\n\n59\n\n\nShakespeare’s First Folio\n\n\n60\n\n\nThe Tragicall Historie of Hamlet, Prince of Denmarke The First (‘Bad’) Quarto\n\n\n61\n\n\nThe Tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark A Study with the Text of the Folio of 1623\n\n\n62\n\n\nShakespeare’s play of the Merchant of Venice Arranged for Representation at the Princess’s Theatre, with Historical and Explanatory Notes by Charles Kean, F.S.A.\n\n\n63\n\n\nKing Henry the Fifth Arranged for Representation at the Princess’s Theatre\n\n\n64\n\n\nThe Works of William Shakespeare [Cambridge Edition] [9 vols.] Introduction and Publisher’s Advertising\n\n\n65\n\n\nThe Tempest The Works of William Shakespeare [Cambridge Edition] [9 vols.]\n\n\n66\n\n\nTwo Gentlemen of Verona The Works of William Shakespeare [Cambridge Edition] [9 vols.]\n\n\n67\n\n\nThe Merry Wives of Windsor The Works of William Shakespeare [Cambridge Edition] [9 vols.]\n\n\n68\n\n\nMeasure for Measure The Works of William Shakespeare [Cambridge Edition] [9 vols.]\n\n\n69\n\n\nThe Comedy of Errors The Works of William Shakespeare [Cambridge Edition] [9 vols.]\n\n\n70\n\n\nThe New Hudson Shakespeare: Julius Cæsar\n\n\n71\n\n\nThe Works of William Shakespeare [Cambridge Edition] [Vol. 2]\n\n\n72\n\n\nShakespeare’s Comedy of The Tempest\n\n\n73\n\n\nThe Works of William Shakespeare [Cambridge Edition] [Vol. 7 of 9]\n\n\n74\n\n\nShakespeare’s Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet\n\n\n75\n\n\nThe Works of William Shakespeare [Cambridge Edition] [Vol. 6 of 9 vols.]\n\n\n76\n\n\nThe Works of William Shakespeare [Cambridge Edition] [Vol. 8 of 9 vols.]\n\n\n77\n\n\nThe Works of William Shakespeare [Cambridge Edition] [Vol. 5 of 9] I, II, and III King Henry Sixth; King Richard III; and two other related plays.\n\n\n78\n\n\nThe Works of William Shakespeare - Cambridge Edition (4 of 9) (1863)\n\n\n79\n\n\nThe Works of William Shakespeare - Cambridge Edition (3 of 9) (1863)\n\n\nSo our text is there and available, at index no. 10.\n\nIDs <-  shakespeare[c(10),]$gutenberg_id\n\nshakespeare %>% \n  filter(gutenberg_id %in% IDs) %>% \n  select(gutenberg_id, title)\n# A tibble: 1 x 2\n  gutenberg_id title                  \n         <int> <chr>                  \n1         1508 The Taming of the Shrew\n\nLet’s download the play and store it in an R object.

this data available, we can now plot the sentiment-per-speaker.\nFirst we’ll make a second dataset that is “wider”: it has one row per speaker and it summarizes n_neg, n_pos, n_total, and neg_ratio.\n\nsentiment_wide <- \n  sentiment %>% \n  filter(speaker %in% sig_speakers) %>% \n  count(speaker, sentiment) %>% \n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = sentiment,\n    values_from = n\n  ) %>% \n  mutate(n_total = negative + positive,\n         neg_ratio = negative/positive) %>% \n  rename(n_neg = negative,\n         n_pos = positive)\n\nSome of this info will be useful to have in the main dataset sentiment. Therefore we’ll left_join() the two.\n\nsentiment %>% \n  filter(speaker %in% sig_speakers) %>% \n  count(speaker, sentiment) %>% \n  left_join(select(sentiment_wide, speaker, n_total)) %>% \n  #---start plot code---#\n  ggplot(aes(x = sentiment,\n             y = n/n_total,\n             fill = speaker)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\",\n           position = \"dodge\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  facet_wrap(~speaker) + \n  labs(y=\"sentiment words scored\") +\n  theme_classic(base_family = \"Roboto Condensed\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\nFigure 1: The ratio between neg. and pos.-coded words by character.\n\n\n\nLet’s now plot just one bar for each speaker, the neg:pos ratio (or neg_ratio, as I will call it). So the highest value will be for the character with the most negative words.\n\nsentiment_wide %>% \n  #---start plot code---#\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(speaker, neg_ratio),\n             y = neg_ratio,\n             fill = -(neg_ratio)\n             )) +\n   geom_hline(yintercept = 1,\n             colour=\"black\", \n             linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_col(alpha=0.8) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_b() +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Sentiment ratio by character\",\n    subtitle=\"Values > 1 indicate greater negative counts\",\n    caption=\"The Taming of the Shrew\",\n    y=\"negative vs. positive words\",\n       x=NULL) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_classic(base_family = \"Roboto Condensed\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\nFigure 2: Sly must be miserable to be around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
